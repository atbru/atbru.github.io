                    <h3>Think People, NOT Resources</h3>
                    <p>Currently the number of jobs to be done far outweighs the number of people skilled enough to do those jobs. The jobs happen in a world where we place value on individuals and interactions over processes and tools. But processes and tools are fundamental in supporting our business operations.<br>
By centring our tools around the user experience of those using them and the interactions we want to encourage then we put ourselves in a much better position to engage and retain top talent.
In this talk I explore maximising value in recruitment, onboarding, career progression and leavers processes through the application of agile and the affect it has on Employer Brand in a very competitive employment market space.</p>

                    <p>
                        This talk is not about dynamic startups, young companies full of ideas. It’s about giants, the x-large ones, national institutions that really have to change now or be uberized and die tomorrow.<br>
Most of the time they just oversee the potential of their employees and don’t really know how to grow leadership. They let wonderful people go…<br>
But it does not have to be that way. <br>
We will talk about leadership. How to recover energy, let new ideas grow, build environments where people feel great and rediscover the desire to innovate. But that’s not all! We will share our experience and tips in making it work in large companies. How to empower teams? How does the structure work? Does it scale?<br>
It’s a session for crazy people by crazy people! People who aim to change the world.

                    <p>So your organisation wants to implement Continuous Delivery. But is your organisation ready for this ? Does it have the right mindset ? To be successful with Continuous Delivery, you have to adopt the proper mindset as a whole organisation. Just throwing tools at it will not do the job.</p>

                    <p>Are you struggling with helping teams to become truly self-organising? Would you like to move away from the slow, bureaucratic power hierarchy in your organisation without ending up in chaos? Are you open for experimenting with new idea’s to help people be more effective?
<br>
If so, then this session is for you. You will get to know Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) as pattern-based framework for happy, conscious and effective collaboration. S3 provides clear, actionable and proven patterns for self-organisation, decision making and structuring ‘bossless’ organisations. It helps organisations that wish to evolve to a more ‘teal’ approach and can be considered as a principle-focused, modular alternative to Holacracy.
<br>
This interactive workshop will combine basic background and theory about S3 with some practical experiments and exercises, to help you experience its dynamics. You will leave the room with a couple of concrete and practical idea’s to try in your team or organisation!</p>

                    <p>This talk is about how financially minded management of companies lead to split the IT management into several business units, each with its own goals and management. This split creates misalignment and conflicts between teams that were supposed to work together.
<br>
This talk is a toolbox designed to help you bring proper implementation of devops and to make people work together on a common goal: efficient automatisation and use of the human brain power geared towards making IT an asset instead of a cost center.</p>

<br>
If you find it hard, or even failed. you may be interested. If you want to agilify beyond the teams, you may be interested too…</p>

                        This workshop is based on the book, the ego is the enemy.

During the workshop you will learn about some of the theory of the book and do some exercises that will make you reflect on your own situation.

                    <p>This session is intended to get you started with projections. You will be implementing projections in your favorite technology based on an event stream we will be providing. We will also provide a client bootstrap in several technologies, so don’t forget to bring your laptop or be prepared to pair with someone else. Mob programming would be awesome. This is not an advanced workshop, so everyone can progress at his/her own pace.

If you want to try this in another technology stack, you must be able to call a REST service with JSON.</p>

                    <p>Why do you write unit test? To verify your code does the right thing? Ok, that’s a fair usage of the unit test. But you can do much more with it.
<br>
Like a couturier, a cabinet-makers, or an ikea designer, you can use the right tool to make elegant and usefull objects.
